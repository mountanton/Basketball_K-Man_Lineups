# Basketball_K-Man_Lineups
A repository with algorithms for computing basketball K-Man lineups statistics. It contains statistics for EuroLeague 2002-23, 2024-25 and 2024-25, and NBA 2023-24. 

**Code**
It contains the code in Java.
You can run it using a IDE such as Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ.

*Run the main in Lattice Basketball Class and it will ask you for input.

*1st: Select the Dataset:A for Euroleague 2022-23, B for Euroleague 2023-24, C for Euroleague 2024-25, D for NBA 2023-24
So you select the desired season.

*2nd: Select Method: Baseline, Semilattice_asc, Semilattice_desc, Semilattice_rand
So you select the desired algorithm.

*3rd: Select the problem (all the computations or a maximization example): All, Maximization
So with all it computes all the K-player lineups, with the maximization it has an example with a maximization and filtering query, for computing the best K-Player lineup with the  most points per minute.

*4th: To Print in File: No, All, 1-Man, 2-Man, 3-Man, 4-Man, 5-Man
So you select if you desire to print in a file the computations.

Afterwards, the code runs and it prints in the end some statitistics about the efficiency.

**Datasets**
In the folder datasets, you can see all the used datasets for the experiments.

**Efficiency Results**
In that folder, you can see all the efficiency results.

**Euroleague K-Man Statistics**
In that folder, you can see all the euroleague K-Man statistics for 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25 (regular season).
